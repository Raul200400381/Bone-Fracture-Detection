# Bone-Fracture-Detection
Early and accurate bone fracture detection is crucial for timely treatment and positive patient        outcomes.Traditional methods like X-rays and CT scans often require human expertise,which can be subjective and time-consuming.Deep learning techniques like YOLOv5 offer promise for automated fracture detection, potentially improving efficiency and accuracy. This project aims to develop a computer- aided system using YOLOv5 in Python to automatically detect bone fractures in X-ray images.The system will leverage the power of deep learning for image recognition and object detection, specifically identifying and localizing fractures in X-ray data.
