# Bone-Fracture-Detection
Early and accurate bone fracture detection is vital for timely treatment. Traditional methods like X-rays require human expertise, which can be subjective and slow. This project uses YOLOv5 in Python to develop an automated system for detecting fractures in X-ray images, leveraging deep learning to enhance efficiency and accuracy in diagnosis.
